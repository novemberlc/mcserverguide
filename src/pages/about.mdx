# About

I started the MC Server Guide to help others and to help myself. I often find myself walking people through how to configure Minecraft server related things, and I sometimes don't quite remember how I did it. This leads to inefficiencies both for myself and whoever I'm helping. Also, sometimes I want to repeat something I did in the past, but I don't remember exactly how I did that either. That's where the guides come in.

I started these guides as a way for me to document and refrence my projects. But then I thought, "Why limit it to me?" I want to bring as many people as possible into this to make it easy to share knowledge with others. It's a big task, but all big things start out small.

If you would like to contribute to the project, check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/novemberlc/mcserverguide). We're mainly focused on Minecraft hosting, but if you have something you think would be helpful, that's great too!
