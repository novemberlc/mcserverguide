# Welcome to the MC Server Guide repo!

I absolutely love open-source projects and knowledge, and I want to share information with everyone to make things easier. If that also sounds like you, please contribute!

## About the project

The MC Server Guide is a simple [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) site. We're open to contributions from everyone! If you just want to view the website, it's live at https://mcguide.org. Check it out!

## Contributing

To contribute, please open an issue first. Describe what you would like to add or change. For simple changes, we can probably just make the change, but for larger things, if we would like to include it, we'll have you open a pull request to add your feature/guide.

Please test your build locally before contributing:

1. Install NodeJS 18 or newer
2. Run `npm init docusaurus` in a new project directory & install the required package
3. Name it what you want, then select the second option: Git repository
4. Provide it with the repository URL
5. Create a deep or shallow clone
6. CD into the new website folder
7. Run `npm install` to install packages if necessary
8. Run `npm start` to run the development server
